Hello guys

I started codecool bootcamp last September. We are going to learn React from March till early May. VUE is unfortunately not in the scope of my bootcamp, but I am happy to start learning it, after I get familiar with React.

Beacause of the lack of knowledge regarding a framework yet, I decided to try to do this frontend challenge in the way I currently can.

I created my backend server in the backend folder, and separately my frontend in the frontend folder.

I created readme files in both folders. Please read them, on how to use this "app"

Why cant you see my commits I made down the line?
I created .git in my backend and my frontend folder separately, which was a mistake from me, I couldnt create a repo on github. I had to delete .git in backend and frontend, and create .git in the route folder...
