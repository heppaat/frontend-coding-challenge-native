Hello guys

Due to the current status of my ongoing front-end studies, I did this challenge without using a framework.
I will start learning React from March until early May. VUE is not in the scope of my bootcamp, but I am happy to get familiar with that as well.

I created my backend server in the backend folder, and separately my frontend in the frontend folder.
I created readme files in both folders. Please read them, on how to use this "app".

Why can't you see my commits I made down the line?
I created .git in my backend and my frontend folder separately, which was a mistake from my side. I couldn't create a repo on github. I had to delete .git in backend and frontend, and create .git in the route folder...
